- Hello there! Koo-san here!
- I am currently studying game desing, I fell in love with the coding aspect of the course and I am very interested in how everything inside a program or a computer work!
- So that's why next year I'm going to get into CS! :)

   Hobbies
    - I like playing the guitar
    - Videogames (though I'm not that much of a gamer anymore I still enjoy gaming, but I'm interested in what's behind the scenes)
    - Drawing & Design
    - Languages!
   
   Education
    - I am a communication and advertising technician!
    - I speak both English and Japanese, though my native language is Spanish
    - Well as mentioned before, I'm jumping into CS! >:3

Anyways! I'm still learning how to use Git correctly, looking forward to learn more in the future!

Greeting ありがとう～!
